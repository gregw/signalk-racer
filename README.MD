# SignalK Plugin for Sail Racing

## Function and goal of the plugin
To calculate values that are relevant to a sail racer: distance/time to line; distance/time to lay line; TWA for next leg; etc.  
Also some a webapp will be implemented to show a rough UI suitable to display these values. However, the long term ambition is 
to have components in KIP and/or FreeboardSK that display the data.
